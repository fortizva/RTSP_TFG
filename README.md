# RTSP_TFG

This project consists of three main components: `RTSP_Client`, `RTSP_Server`, and `SimpleCodec`.

## Components

### RTSP_Client
The `RTSP_Client` is an RTSP streaming player. It is designed to connect to an RTSP server, receive media streams, and play them back in real-time.

### RTSP_Server
The `RTSP_Server` is an RTSP streaming server. It serves media streams to RTSP clients, enabling real-time streaming over the RTSP protocol.

### SimpleCodec
The `SimpleCodec` is a custom codec tool for encoding MP4 files. It ensures that the encoded files are compatible with the `RTSP_Client` and `RTSP_Server` components of this project.

## Usage
Each component has its own specific usage instructions. Refer to the respective documentation or code comments for detailed guidance on how to use them.
